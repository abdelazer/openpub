# Make your feed easy to crawl #

  * Add a "crawlable" link relation to your feed
  * Use stable urns in your atom:ids
  * Make your entire feed available for bulk download
  * Add additional identifiers in dc:identifier, such as urn:isbn:xxxx. ISBN, LCCN, OCLC, and OL ids would be useful for merging.
