# Discussion #

> ## Priority enhancements ##

Priorities for enhancements were discussed, and included:

**Indirect acquisitions**.  Support for these relationships has been previously discussed but no form has been endorsed for OPDS usage.  In general, it is believed that a quick review of link relation handling would be constructive after nearly nine months of v1.0 availability.

**Rights metadata**.  The need to support territorial distinctions in access and pricing is a real "on the ground" issue for international ebook and media providers.

**Search and discovery**.  The need for enhancements in OPDS Catalog discovery, focusing primarily on faceted browsing and navigation.

> ## Miscellaneous ##

Voyager Japan discussed their early experiences integrating OPDS Catalogs, including frustrations with multibyte support, differential client handling of Catalogs, and the inability of browsers to natively hand OPDS (partially remediable).

The desire for clients to support direct OPDS Catalog discovery and acquisition was discussed.

The consideration of non book media in OPDS Catalogs was discussed; this has always been a design goal of OPDS, and forays into audio book catalogs were discussed as an entry point.  (e.g. Librivox).

# Conclusion #

The group felt that an OPDS v1.1 need not encompass many significant changes, but could focus neatly on a few points.

A tentative deadline of summer for enhancement specification was pronounced, with the aim of targeting public release for the Tokyo Book Fair, and subsequently the Frankfurt Book Fair.

Additional participants need to be recruited to support the v1.1 development activities.
