The Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) Catalog is a
syndication format for electronic publications based on Atom [RFC4287](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt) and HTTP [RFC2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt). Catalogs enable the aggregation, distribution, discovery, and acquisition of electronic publications. OPDS Catalogs use
existing or emergent open standards and conventions, with a priority on simplicity.
