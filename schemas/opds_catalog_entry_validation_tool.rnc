#  Instead of using Schematron to assert that any atom:link with a rel value of ".../acquisition/buy" must be
#  accompanied by an opds:price element, here the situation is described as one of three situations:
#  - the rel value is ".../acquisition/buy" and an opds:price element is required
#  - the rel value is ".../acquisition/borrow" or ".../acquisition/subscribe" or ".../acquisition/sample", in
#    case a single opds:price element may be included; or
#  - the value of the rel attribute is any other URI or an Atom-defined no-colon name, and no opds:price element is permitted

#  Note that this schema includes the atom.rnc schema, so that schema must be present for validation
#  Note also that atom.rnc defines atomUri as text and not as xsd:anyURI, and so wherever the Atom spec
#  requires an IRI, the schema will not check the value against any URI pattern or logic
#  Probably we want to change this for the OPDS schema, perhaps using XSD v1.1
#  In this version, we'll settle for catching some bad URI's at the cost of not actually matching the spec
