#labels meetingnotes

= Attendees =

  * Keith
  * Liza
  * Raj
  * Cart
  * Tim 
  * Hadrien
  * Peter

= Open Search and use of Accept headers =

It was generally agreed that the use of Accept headers may be a way to implement faceted searching using Open Search, but pursuing an Open Search extension may be the most appropriate way to support this.

There is a method to support faceted search but it requires some work on the server side which I did not understand [FIXME].

= Acquisition links =

We agreed on a method to indicate that an HTML shopping cart will be provided to acquire a title, but we need additional work on describing other forms of paid acquisition.

= Atom summary versus content =

Currently the atom:content element can include arbitrary HTML markup, but this puts a burden on simpler reading systems (such as Flash-based ones) that cannot handle arbitrary markup.  

However, the ability to have some basic formatting is desirable.

*We will require atom:content with @type="text" to provide additional enticement copy for an entry, but that content may be empty.*

= Hierarchical catalogs =

Keith is concerned that hierarchical catalogs are difficult to aggregate, but they are attractive for simple catalog providers and consumers.

* Hadrien to write up some recommended @rel values ("featured", "bestsellers") for sub-catalogs, and the ability to include sub-catalogs will be retained.*
