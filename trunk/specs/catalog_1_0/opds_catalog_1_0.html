    <p>The Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) Catalog format
is a syndication format for electronic publications based on Atom
and HTTP. OPDS Catalogs enable the aggregation, distribution,
discovery, and acquisition of electronic publications. OPDS
Catalogs use existing or emergent open standards and conventions,
with a priority on simplicity.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) Catalog format
is a syndication format for electronic publications based on Atom
<tt>[RFC4287]</tt> and HTTP <tt>[RFC2616]</tt>. OPDS Catalogs
enable available electronic publications to be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>discovered, using optional search or a range of optional
browsing techniques</li>
      <li>acquired, using direct downloads, lending, or vending</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An OPDS Catalog is a set of one or more Atom Feeds, which are
themselves listings of Atom Entries. The Atom Feeds that make up
all OPDS Catalogs can be divided into two groups: Navigation Feeds,
which create a hierarchy for browsing, and Acquisition Feeds, which
list available electronic publications. Each Atom Entry in an
Acquisition Feed includes basic metadata about the publication, the
publication's format, and how the publication can be acquired.
These included Atom Entries may be minimal subsets of the complete
metadata, with a link to a more extensive, standalone
representation URI (see the Section Listing Acquisition Feeds for
more).</p>
    <p>OPDS Catalogs may be aggregated and combined into larger OPDS
Catalogs.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="Notational_Conventions">
    <h1>Notational Conventions</h1>
    <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in
<tt>[RFC2119]</tt>.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="XML-Related_Conventions">
    <h1>XML-Related Conventions</h1>
    <div id="Referring_to_Information_Items">
      <h2>Referring to Information Items</h2>
      <p>The OPDS Catalog format is specified in terms of the XML
Information Set <tt>[REC-xml-infoset]</tt>, serialized as XML 1.0
<tt>[REC-xml]</tt>.</p>
      <p>The Infoset terms "Element Information Item" and "Attribute
Information Item" are shortened to "element" and "attribute"
respectively. Therefore, when this specification uses the term
"element", it is referring to an Element Information Item, and when
it uses the term "attribute", it is referring to an Attribute
Information Item.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="RELAX_NG_Schema">
    <h1>RELAX NG Schema</h1>
    <p>Some sections of this specification are illustrated with
fragments of a non-normative RELAX NG Compact schema
<tt>[RNC]</tt>. However, the text of this specification provides
the definition of conformance. Complete schemas appear in Appendix
B.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="Terminology">
    <h1>Terminology</h1>
    <p>The following terminology is used by this specification:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acquisition Feed -- An Atom Feed whose Atom Entries are
exclusively OPDS Catalog Entries.</li>
      <li>Acquisition Link -- An atom:link element with a relation that
begins with "<a href="http://opds-spec.org/acquisition" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/acquisition</a>" and refers to the
Resource which holds the content of the described Publication or
the Resource through which it may be acquired for any OPDS Catalog
Entry. See the Sections Acquisition Relations and Acquiring
Publications. They are serialized as OPDS Catalog Feed
Documents.</li>
      <li>Complete Catalog Entry -- An OPDS Catalog Entry that includes
all known metadata about the described Publication and is
referenced by a Partial Catalog Entry.</li>
      <li>IRI -- An Internationalized Resource Identifier as defined in
<tt>[RFC3987]</tt>.</li>
      <li>Navigation Feed -- An Atom Feed whose Atom Entries are not OPDS
Catalog Entries but instead links to other Navigation Feeds,
Acquisition Feeds, or other Resources to establish a hierarchical,
browsable presentation of the OPDS Catalog.</li>
      <li>OPDS Catalog -- All of the Atom Feeds (Acquisition and
Navigation) and Entries (Partial and Complete) following this
specification published together to describe a consolidated group
of available Publications.</li>
      <li>OPDS Catalog Entry -- An Atom Entry that provides a
representation of an available Publication and includes an
Acquisition Link. They are serialized as OPDS Catalog Entry
Documents.</li>
      <li>OPDS Catalog Entry Document -- The formal name for the XML
documents that are a refinement of an "atom:entry" from the Atom
Syndication Format <tt>[RFC4287]</tt> that this specification
defines.</li>
      <li>OPDS Catalog Feed Document -- The formal name for XML documents
that are a refinement of an "atom:feed" from the Atom Syndication
Format <tt>[RFC4287]</tt> that this specification defines.</li>
      <li>OPDS Catalog Root -- The Atom Feed that represents either the
complete OPDS Catalog (a single Acquisition Feed) or the Atom Feed
that starts a set of Navigation Feeds. External links to the OPDS
Catalog SHOULD reference the OPDS Catalog Root Resource.</li>
      <li>Partial Catalog Entry --- An OPDS Catalog Entry that includes
the minimal required metadata about the described Publication but
no other metadata and links to the Complete Catalog Entry.</li>
      <li>Publication - An electronic document, typically available as a
single file. OPDS Catalogs are agnostic about the particular format
of Publications.</li>
      <li>relation (or "relation of") -- Refers to the "rel" attribute
value of an atom:link element.</li>
      <li>Representation -- An entity included with a request or response
as defined in <tt>[RFC2616]</tt>.</li>
      <li>Resource -- A network-accessible data object or service
identified by an IRI, as defined in <tt>[RFC2616]</tt>. See
<tt>[REC-webarch]</tt> for further discussion on Resources.</li>
      <li>URI -- A Uniform Resource Identifier as defined in
<tt>[RFC3986]</tt>. In this specification, the phrase "the URI of a
document" is shorthand for "a URI which, when dereferenced, is
expected to produce that document as a representation".</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="Document_Types">
    <h1>Document Types</h1>
    <p>This specification defines two kinds of documents -- OPDS
Catalog Feed Documents and OPDS Catalog Entry Documents.</p>
    <p>An OPDS Catalog Feed Document is a refinement of an "atom:feed"
from the Atom Syndication Format <tt>[RFC4287]</tt>.</p>
    <p>An OPDS Catalog Entry Document is a refinement of an
"atom:entry" from the Atom Syndication Format
<tt>[RFC4287]</tt>.</p>
    <p>The namespace name <tt>[REC-xml-names]</tt> for elements defined
in this specification and used in OPDS Catalog Feed Documents and
OPDS Catalog Entry Documents is:</p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://opds-spec.org/2010/catalog" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/2010/catalog</a>
    </p>
    <p>OPDS Catalog Feed Documents and OPDS Catalog Entry Documents
MUST be "namespace-well-formed" as specified in Section 7 of
<tt>[REC-xml-names]</tt>.</p>
    <p>This specification uses the prefix "opds:" for the namespace
name. The prefix "atom:" is used for "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom</a> ", the namespace name of
the Atom Syndication Format <tt>[RFC4287]</tt>. The prefix "dc:" is
used for"<a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" rel="nofollow">http://purl.org/dc/terms/</a>", the namespace name of
Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Metadata Terms
<tt>[DCTERMS]</tt>. These namespace prefixes are not semantically
significant.</p>
    <p>Producers of OPDS Catalogs SHOULD produce OPDS Catalog Feed
Documents and OPDS Catalog Entry Documents that are conformant to
both Atom and the OPDS Catalog RELAX NG schemas.</p>
    <div id="Document_Extensibility">
      <h2>Document Extensibility</h2>
      <p>Unrecognized markup in any Atom Feed or Atom Entry in an OPDS
Catalog is considered "foreign markup" as defined in Section 6 of
the Atom Syndication Format <tt>[RFC4287]</tt>. Foreign markup can
be used anywhere within an OPDS Catalog unless it is explicitly
forbidden. Processors that encounter foreign markup MUST NOT stop
processing and MUST NOT signal an error. Clients SHOULD preserve
foreign markup when transmitting or aggregating such documents.</p>
      <p>The namespace name "<a href="http://opds-spec.org/2010/catalog" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/2010/catalog</a>" is reserved
for forward-compatible revisions of the OPDS Catalog format. This
does not exclude the addition of elements and attributes that might
not be recognized by processors conformant to this specification.
Such unrecognized markup from the "<a href="http://opds-spec.org/2010/catalog" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/2010/catalog</a>" namespace MUST be
treated as foreign markup.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="OPDS_Catalog_Feed_Documents">
    <h1>OPDS Catalog Feed Documents</h1>
    <p>OPDS Catalog Feed Documents are Atom <tt>[RFC4287]</tt> Feeds.
They serve two purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To create a browsable hierarchy of other OPDS Catalog Feed
Documents and other Resources. These OPDS Catalog Feed Documents
are referred to as Navigation Feeds.</li>
      <li>To collect a set of OPDS Catalog Entries. These OPDS Catalog
Feed Documents are referred to as Acquisition Feeds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While Navigation Feeds do provide a suggested hierarchy from the
OPDS Catalog publisher, OPDS Catalog Feed Documents MAY contain
other relations that allow for other methods of consumption and
display. See the Section OPDS Catalog Relations for more
detail.</p>
    <p>Every OPDS Catalog Feed Document MUST either be an Acquisition
Feed or a Navigation Feed. An Acquisition Feed can be identified by
the presence of Acquisition Links in each Atom Entry.</p>
    <div id="OPDS_Catalog_Root">
      <h2>OPDS Catalog Root</h2>
      <p>The OPDS Catalog Root is the top-level OPDS Catalog Feed
Document. It is either a single Acquisition Feed in the simple case
or the start of a set of Navigation Feeds. Every OPDS Catalog MUST
have one and only one OPDS Catalog Root.</p>
      <p>External links to the OPDS Catalog Resource SHOULD use the IRI
of the OPDS Catalog Root.</p>
      <p>Each OPDS Catalog Feed Document SHOULD contain an atom:link
element with a link relation of "start", which references the OPDS
Catalog Root Resource.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Navigation_Feeds">
      <h2>Navigation Feeds</h2>
      <p>A Navigation Feed is an OPDS Catalog Feed Document whose Atom
Entries serve to create a suggested hierarchy for presentation and
browsing. A Navigation Feed MUST NOT contain OPDS Catalog Entries
but instead contains Atom Entries that link to other Navigation or
Acquisition Feeds or other Resources. Each Atom Entry's
"atom:content" element SHOULD include a brief description of the
linked Resource.</p>
      <p>Links to Navigation Feeds SHOULD use the "type" attribute
"application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog". OPDS Catalog providers
SHOULD choose the best relation for each Navigation Feed based on
the relations in the section OPDS Catalog Relations. The relation
"subsection" SHOULD be used if no other relation is more
appropriate.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Acquisition_Feeds">
      <h2>Acquisition Feeds</h2>
      <p>An Acquisition Feed is an OPDS Catalog Feed Document that
collects OPDS Catalog Entries into a single, ordered set. The
simplest complete OPDS Catalog would be a single Acquisition Feed
listing all of the available OPDS Catalog Entries from that
provider. In more complex OPDS Catalogs, Acquisition Feeds are used
to present and organize sets of related OPDS Catalog Entries for
browsing and discovery by clients and aggregators.</p>
      <p>Links to Acquisition Feeds SHOULD use the "type" attribute
"application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog".</p>
      <p>For further details on limiting the size of Acquisition Feeds
through pagination, Partial Catalog Entries, and compression, see
the Section Listing Acquisition Feeds.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="OPDS_Catalog_Relations">
      <h2>OPDS Catalog Relations</h2>
      <p>OPDS Catalog Feed Documents SHOULD include links to other
available Acquisition and Navigation Feeds and other related
Resources to encourage independent navigation.</p>
      <p>These relations MAY be used by clients to provide additional or
alternative navigation, both in a Navigation Feed or an Acquisition
Feed.</p>
      <p>The following relations are derived from
<tt>[DRAFT-Web-Linking]</tt>, with some clarification:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"start": The OPDS Catalog Root.</li>
        <li>"subsection": A Navigation Feed not better described by a more
specific relation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When creating an OPDS Catalog with Navigation and Acquisition
Feeds, OPDS Catalog providers are encouraged to use the relations
defined in this specification and <tt>[DRAFT-Web-Linking]</tt>. If
no appropriate relation is found, the Feeds SHOULD use a
descriptive "atom:title" element and the "atom:link"s SHOULD use a
descriptive "title" attribute.</p>
      <div id="Sorting_Relations">
        <h3>Sorting Relations</h3>
        <p>This specification defines two new relations, which begin with
"<a href="http://opds-spec.org/sort" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/sort</a>", to describe how an
Acquisition Feed is sorted. These relations SHOULD be used when
creating Navigation Feeds and the OPDS Catalog Root, if
applicable.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"<a href="http://opds-spec.org/sort/new" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/sort/new</a>": An Acquisition Feed
with newly released OPDS Catalog Entries. These Acquisition Feeds
typically contain a subset of the OPDS Catalog Entries in an OPDS
Catalog based on the publication date of the Publication.</li>
          <li>"<a href="http://opds-spec.org/sort/popular" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/sort/popular</a>": An Acquisition
Feed with popular OPDS Catalog Entries. These Acquisition Feeds
typically contain a subset of the OPDS Catalog Entries in an OPDS
Catalog based on a numerical ranking criteria.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Acquisition Feeds using the "<a href="http://opds-spec.org/sort/new" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/sort/new</a>" relation SHOULD be
ordered with the most recent items first. Acquisition Feeds using
the "<a href="http://opds-spec.org/sort/popular" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/sort/popular</a>" relation SHOULD
be ordered with the most popular items first.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Popular_Relation">
        <h3>Popular Relation</h3>
        <p>This specification also defines a relation to describe an
Acquisition Feed of featured items. This relation SHOULD be used
when creating Navigation Feeds and the OPDS Catalog Root, if
applicable.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"<a href="http://opds-spec.org/featured" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/featured</a>": An Acquisition Feed
with featured OPDS Catalog Entries. These Acquisition Feeds
typically contain a subset of the OPDS Catalog Entries in an OPDS
Catalog that have been selected for promotion by the OPDS Catalog
provider. No order is implied.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="Relations_for_Previously_Acquired_Content">
        <h3>Relations for Previously Acquired Content</h3>
        <p>An OPDS catalog MAY track content that was previously acquired
by the user. This specification defines two new relations to
identify Acquisition Feeds listing such resources:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"<a href="http://opds-spec.org/shelf" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/shelf</a>": A Resource that
includes a user's existing set of Acquired Content, which MAY be
represented as an OPDS Catalog.</li>
          <li>"<a href="http://opds-spec.org/subscriptions" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/subscriptions</a>": A Resource that
includes a user's set of subscriptions, which MAY be represented as
an OPDS Catalog.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An OPDS client MAY use these links to automatically sync content
to the user's local shelf or check for periodical content
updates.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Crawlable_Feed_Relation">
        <h3>Crawlable Feed Relation</h3>
        <p>For aggregation or crawling purposes, an OPDS Catalog MAY link
to an optimized Acquisition Feed. This specification defines one
new relation for this goal: "<a href="http://opds-spec.org/crawlable" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/crawlable</a>".</p>
        <p>See Complete Acquisition Feeds for more information about this
feed.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="Search">
      <h2>Search</h2>
      <p>An OPDS Catalog MAY provide a search facility through an
<tt>[OpenSearch]</tt> description document. Links to
<tt>[OpenSearch]</tt> description documents MUST use the "search"
relation value and the "application/opensearchdescription+xml"
media type as defined in the "Autodiscovery" section of the
<tt>[OpenSearch]</tt> specification.</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;link rel="search" 
      href="search.xml" 
      type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"/&gt;

      <p>In an <tt>[OpenSearch]</tt> description document, the search
interface SHOULD use the media type associated to OPDS

      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;Url type="application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog"
     template="http://example.com/search?q={searchTerms}" /&gt;
</pre>
      <p>OPDS Catalog Feed Documents MAY include elements from the
<tt>[OpenSearch]</tt> namespace such as "opensearch:totalResults"
or "opensearch:itemsPerPage" in <tt>[OpenSearch]</tt>
responses.</p>

        <h3>The "atom:feed" Element</h3>
        <p>The "atom:feed" element is the document (i.e., top-level)
element of an OPDS Catalog Feed Document, acting as a container for
metadata, hierarchy, and Publications associated with the OPDS
Catalog. Its element children consist of metadata elements followed
by zero or more atom:entry child elements.</p>
        <p>The following child elements are refined by this
specification:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>OPDS Catalog Feed Documents SHOULD contain one atom:link
element with a "rel" attribute value of "self". This is the
preferred URI for retrieving the atom:feed representing this OPDS
Catalog Feed Document.</li>
        </ul>

  </div>
  <div id="OPDS_Catalog_Entry_Documents">
    <h1>OPDS Catalog Entry Documents</h1>
    <p>OPDS Catalog Entry Documents are Atom <tt>[RFC4287]</tt> Entry
documents that provide a complete representation of the metadata
and data associated with an available Publication.</p>
    <p>Each OPDS Catalog Entry Document MUST include at least one
Acquisition Link, which is an atom:link element with a relation
that begins "<a href="http://opds-spec.org/acquisition" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/acquisition</a>". This link refers
to the Resource which is the content of the Resource described by
the OPDS Catalog Entry in a particular media type. Acquisition
Links use one of the relations described in the Section Acquisition
Relations.</p>
    <div id="Relationship_Between_Atom_and_Dublin_Core_Metadata">
      <h2>Relationship Between Atom and Dublin Core Metadata</h2>
      <p>OPDS Catalog providers are encouraged to include metadata from
the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Metadata Terms
<tt>[DCTERMS]</tt> whenever appropriate. However, these elements
are not required. Some of the elements defined in
<tt>[DCTERMS]</tt> overlap in meaning with similar elements defined
by Atom in <tt>[RFC4287]</tt>. In general, OPDS Catalog Entries
prefer the Atom elements over the <tt>[DCTERMS]</tt> elements and
the following rules should be used by OPDS Catalog providers when
choosing elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>OPDS Catalog Entries MUST be identified by an "atom:id". One or
more "dc:identifier" elements SHOULD be used to identify the
represented Publication, if appropriate metadata is available, and
MUST NOT identify the OPDS Catalog Entry.</li>
        <li>OPDS Catalog Entries MUST include an "atom:updated" element
indicating when the OPDS Catalog Entry was last updated. A
"dc:issued" element SHOULD be used to indicate the first
publication date of the Publication and MUST NOT represent any date
related to the OPDS Catalog Entry.</li>
        <li>OPDS Catalog Entries MUST include an "atom:title" representing
the Publication's title and MUST NOT use "dc:title".</li>
        <li>OPDS Catalog Entries SHOULD use "atom:author" to represent the
Publication's creators and SHOULD NOT use "dc:creator".</li>
        <li>OPDS Catalog Entries SHOULD use "atom:category" to represent
the Publication's category, keywords, key phrases, or
classification codes and SHOULD NOT use "dc:subject".</li>
        <li>OPDS Catalog Entries SHOULD use "atom:rights" to represent
rights held in and over the Publication and SHOULD NOT use
"dc:rights".</li>
        <li>OPDS Catalog Entries SHOULD use "atom:summary" and/or
"atom:content" to describe the Publication SHOULD NOT use
"dc:description" or "dc:abstract".</li>
        <li>OPDS Catalog Entries MAY use "atom:contributor" to represent
contributors to the Publication beside its creators.</li>
        <li>OPDS Catalog Entries MAY use "atom:published" to indicate when
the OPDS Catalog Entry was first accessible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All metadata elements required by Atom are required in OPDS
Catalog Entries and Feeds.</p>
      <p>Following Atom <tt>[RFC4287]</tt> Section 4.2.6, the content of
an "atom:id" identifying an OPDS Catalog Entry MUST NOT change when
the OPDS Catalog Entry is "relocated, migrated, syndicated,
republished, exported, or imported" and "MUST be created in a way
that assures uniqueness."</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Partial_and_Complete_Catalog_Entries">
      <h2>Partial and Complete Catalog Entries</h2>
      <p>An OPDS Catalog Entry may be represented as either a Partial or
Complete Catalog Entry. Partial Catalog Entries include only
critical metadata elements to reduce the size of OPDS Catalog
documents for bandwidth- and resource-limited clients and link to
their alternate representation as a Complete Catalog Entries, which
include all metadata elements.</p>
      <p>A Partial Catalog Entry MUST include an "alternate" link
relation referencing the Complete Catalog Entry Resource and that
atom:link MUST use the "type" attribute
"application/atom+xml;type=entry;profile=opds-catalog".</p>
      <p>Any OPDS Catalog Entry without a link to a Complete Catalog
Entry MUST include all metadata elements.</p>
      <p>Partial Catalog Entries SHOULD include the following metadata
elements, if available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>atom:category</li>
        <li>atom:contributor</li>
        <li>atom:rights</li>
        <li>opds:price</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OPDS Catalog providers are strongly encouraged to limit metadata
elements not required by Atom, OPDS, or listed above from Partial
Catalog Entries to help facilitate the efficient transmission and
consumption of OPDS Catalog documents. Implementers are encouraged
to include metadata elements from other vocabularies in Complete
Catalog Entries.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Summary_and_Content">
      <h2>Summary and Content</h2>
      <p>OPDS Catalog Entries use "atom:content" and "atom:summary"
elements to describe a Publication. This is a distinction from Atom
<tt>[RFC4287]</tt>, which uses "atom:content" for the "content of
the entry." Instead, OPDS Catalog Entries reference an electronic
document with the Publication's content using Acquisition Links.
OPDS Catalog Entries SHOULD include either "atom:summary" or
"atom:content" elements or both to provide a description, summary,
abstract, or excerpt of the Publication.</p>
      <p>An "atom:summary" element in an OPDS Catalog Entry MUST use a
"type" attribute of "text" and the content MUST NOT contain child
elements. The content of an "atom:summary" element SHOULD NOT
duplicate the content of "atom:title" or "atom:content". Such text
is intended to be presented to humans in a readable fashion. The
restriction of the content of "atom:summary" and the "type"
attribute is a restriction of Atom <tt>[RFC4287]</tt>.</p>
      <p>An "atom:content" element in an OPDS Catalog Entry either
contains or links to a description, summary, abstract, or excerpt
of the Publication. The behavior or "atomOutOfLineContent" and the
"src" attribute is defined in Section 4.1.3 of
<tt>[RFC4287]</tt>.</p>
      <p>If an OPDS Catalog Entry includes both "atom:content" and
"atom:summary", the "atom:content" SHOULD NOT be included in the
Partial Catalog Entry. Both elements SHOULD be included in the
Complete Catalog Entry.</p>

      <h2>Entry Relations</h2>
      <p>OPDS Catalog Entry Documents SHOULD include links to related
Resources. This specification defines new relations for linking
from OPDS Catalog Entry Documents. They are defined in the Sections
Acquisition Relations and Artwork Relations.</p>
      <p>OPDS Catalog providers are encouraged to use relations from
<tt>[DRAFT-Web-Linking]</tt> inside OPDS Catalog Entry Documents
where appropriate.</p>
      <div id="Acquisition_Relations">
        <h3>Acquisition Relations</h3>
        <p>Acquisition relations describe the extent of the content
referred to by an Acquisition Link or the manner in which that

        <h3>Artwork Relations</h3>
        <p>OPDS Catalog Entries MAY include atom:links to images that
provide a visual representation of the Publication. For many
Publications, these images will be the Publication's artwork. This
specification defines two Artwork Relations, which begin with
"<a href="http://opds-spec.org/image" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/image</a>":</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"<a href="http://opds-spec.org/image" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/image</a>": a graphical Resource

          <li>"<a href="http://opds-spec.org/image/thumbnail" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/image/thumbnail</a>": a
reduced-size version of a graphical Resource associated to the OPS

        </ul>
        <p>Image resources related by <a href="http://opds-spec.org/image/thumbnail" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/image/thumbnail</a> SHOULD be
suitable for presentation at a small size.</p>
        <p>The atom:links with these relations SHOULD include at least one
link with a type attribute of "image/gif", "image/jpeg", or
"image/png" and the image Resources MUST be in GIF, JPEG, or PNG
format.</p>
        <p>Additional atom:links MAY also include additional resources
using a vector-based format.</p>
        <p>While either image Resource is optional and may be included
independently, OPDS Catalog providers are encouraged to provide
both these relations and Resources whenever possible.</p>
        <p>Some OPDS Catalog providers MAY choose to provide <a href="http://opds-spec.org/image/thumbnail" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/image/thumbnail</a> image Resources
using the "data" URL scheme from <tt>[RFC2397]</tt>. OPDS Catalog

    <h1>Acquiring Publications</h1>
    <p>The goal of OPDS Catalogs is to make Publications both
discoverable and straightforward to acquire on a range of devices
and platforms. To support that goal, this specification strives to
provide a framework for describing how a Publication may be
acquired while not attempting to constrain this very complex topic.
Commonly-used acquisition scenarios may be specified in an update
to this specification.</p>
    <p>All Acquisition Links MUST include a "type" attribute that
advises clients on the media type of the representation that is
expected to be returned when the value of the href attribute is
dereferenced. As with Atom, the value of the type attribute MUST
conform to the syntax of a MIME media type <tt>[MIMEREG]</tt>.</p>
    <p>Publications in a format using Digital Rights Management SHOULD
use a different value for the type attribute of the Acquisition
Link than the same format without Digital Rights Management.</p>
    <p>OPDS Catalog clients may only support a subset of all possible
Publication media types. These clients will need to filter both the
type attribute of Acquisition Links.</p>
    <div id="Acquisition_Examples">
      <h2>Acquisition Examples</h2>
      <p>The simplest case is a Publication available in one format:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;link rel="http://opds-spec.org/acquisition" 
      type="video/mp4v-es" 
      href="/content/free/4561.mp4"/&gt;
</pre>
      <p>If the Publication was available in multiple formats as unique
Resources, they would simply be listed:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;link rel="http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/borrow" 
      href="/content/borrow/4561.mobi"/&gt;

      type="application/epub+zip" 
</pre>
      <p>If the Publication requires payment, at least one opds:price

&lt;/link&gt;

  <div id="Feed_Handling">
    <h1>Feed Handling</h1>
    <div id="Listing_Acquisition_Feeds">
      <h2>Listing Acquisition Feeds</h2>
      <p>OPDS Catalog Feed Documents, especially Acquisition Feeds, may
contain large numbers of Atom Entries.</p>
      <p>A client such as a web spider or web browser might be
overwhelmed if the response to a GET contained every Atom Entry in
an Acquisition Feed -- in turn the server might also waste
bandwidth and processing time on generating a response that cannot
be handled. For this reason, servers MAY respond to Acquisition
Feed GET requests with a paginated response: an OPDS Catalog Feed
Document containing a partial list of the Acquisition Feed's member
Atom Entries and a link to the next partial Acquisition Feed, if it
exists, as defined in Section 3 of <tt>[RFC5005]</tt>.</p>
      <p>OPDS Catalog providers SHOULD use Partial Catalog Entries in all
Acquisition Feeds except Complete Acquisition Feeds, which are
intended for crawling and are referenced using the <a href="http://opds-spec.org/crawlable" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/crawlable</a> relation.</p>
      <p>Clients MUST NOT assume that an OPDS Catalog Entry returned in
the Acquisition Feed is a full representation of an OPDS Catalog
Entry Resource, as described in the Section Partial and Complete
Entries.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Complete_Acquisition_Feeds">
      <h2>Complete Acquisition Feeds</h2>
      <p>An OPDS Catalog provider MAY provide a single, consolidated
Acquisition Feed that includes the complete representation of every
unique OPDS Catalog Entry Document in an OPDS Catalog in an
atom:feed to facilitate crawling and aggregation. Complete
Acquisition Feeds SHOULD NOT be paginated unless they are extremely
large.</p>
      <p>This representation is called a Complete Acquisition Feed and
each OPDS Catalog Entry MUST be ordered by atom:updated, with the
most recently updated Atom Entries coming first in the document
order.</p>
      <p>If available, each OPDS Catalog Feed Document in the OPDS
Catalog SHOULD contain an atom:link element with a relation of
"<a href="http://opds-spec.org/crawlable" rel="nofollow">http://opds-spec.org/crawlable</a>" that references the
Complete Acquisition Feed Resource.</p>
      <p>A Complete Acquisition Feed MUST include a fh:complete element
from <tt>[RFC5005]</tt> unless pagination is required. See Section
2 of <tt>[RFC5005]</tt> for the specification of the fh:complete
element.</p>
      <p>OPDS Catalog providers SHOULD use a compressed Content-Encoding
when transmitting Complete Acquisition Feeds over HTTP. See Section
14.11 of <tt>[RFC2616]</tt> for more on compression.</p>
      <p>OPDS Catalog providers MUST include Complete Catalog Entries
when serializing a Complete Acquisition Feed.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="Aggregating_OPDS_Catalogs">
    <h1>Aggregating OPDS Catalogs</h1>
    <p>OPDS Catalogs may be aggregated using the same techniques as
Atom Feeds. Aggregators SHOULD use the atom:source element from
Section 4.2.11 of <tt>[RFC4287]</tt> to include information about
the original OPDS Catalog.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="Discovering_OPDS_Catalogs">
    <h1>Discovering OPDS Catalogs</h1>
    <p>OPDS Catalogs may be referenced in HTML/XHTML pages, HTTP
headers, or using other techniques. These links may reference both
OPDS Catalog Entries or Feeds. Links to OPDS Catalog Entry Document
Resources MUST use a type attribute of
"application/atom+xml;type=entry;profile=opds-catalog". Links to
OPDS Catalog Feed Document Resources MUST use a type attribute of
"application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog".</p>
    <p>The most common mechanism for encouraging the auto-discovery of
OPDS Catalogs is to link from an HTML document to the OPDS Catalog
Root Resource, using the auto-discovery pattern popularized by the
syndicated feed community <tt>[AUTODISCOVERY]</tt>.</p>
    <p>Multiple links to OPDS Catalog Resources MAY be expressed in a
single HTML document.</p>
    <p>An example of two links inside an HTML page about the same
Publication:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;link rel="related"   
      href="/opds-catalogs/root" 
      type="application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog"  
      title="Example OPDS Catalog" /&gt; 

&lt;link rel="alternate" 
      href="/entry/1"
      type="application/atom+xml;type=entry;profile=opds-catalog" 
      title="Example OPDS Entry" /&gt; 
</pre>
    <p>Auto-discovery links MAY also be expressed using HTTP headers as
defined in <tt>[DRAFT-Web-Linking]</tt>.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="Securing_OPDS_Catalogs">
    <h1>Securing OPDS Catalogs</h1>
    <p>OPDS Catalogs are delivered over HTTP. Authentication
requirements for HTTP are covered in Section 11 of
<tt>[RFC2616]</tt>.</p>
    <p>The type of authentication required for any OPDS Catalog is a
decision to be made by the OPDS Catalog provider. OPDS Catalog
clients are likely to face authentication schemes that vary across
OPDS Catalogs. At a minimum, client and server implementations MUST
be capable of being configured to use HTTP Basic Authentication
<tt>[RFC2617]</tt> in conjunction with a connection made with TLS
1.0 <tt>[RFC2246]</tt> or a subsequent standards-track version of
TLS supporting the conventions for using HTTP over TLS described in
<tt>[RFC2818]</tt>. It is RECOMMENDED that OPDS Catalog clients be
implemented in such a way that new authentication schemes can be
deployed.</p>
    <p>Because this protocol uses HTTP response status codes as the
primary means of reporting the result of a request, OPDS Catalog
providers are advised to respond to unauthorized or unauthenticated
requests using an appropriate 4xx HTTP response code (e.g., 401
"Unauthorized" or 403 "Forbidden") in accordance with
<tt>[RFC2617]</tt>.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="Bandwidth_and_Processing_Considerations">
    <h1>Bandwidth and Processing Considerations</h1>
    <p>Many OPDS Catalog clients operate in mobile environments, which
may impose strict limitations on bandwidth and processing
resources. OPDS Catalog publishers are strongly encouraged to
publish their OPDS Catalogs using compression and caching
techniques and the partial feeds described in the Section Listing
Acquisition Feeds. Implementers are encouraged to investigate and
use alternative mechanisms regarded as equivalently good or better
at the time of deployment. See <tt>[CACHING]</tt> for more on
caching techniques.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="Security_Considerations">
    <h1>Security Considerations</h1>
    <p>OPDS Catalogs are Atom documents delivered over HTTP and thus
subject to the security considerations found in Section 15 of
<tt>[RFC2616]</tt> and Section 5 of <tt>[RFC4287]</tt>.</p>
    <div id="Linked_Resources">
      <h2>Linked Resources</h2>
      <p>OPDS Catalogs can contain XML External Entities as defined in
Section 4.2.2 of <tt>[REC-xml]</tt>. OPDS Catalog implementations
are not required to load external entities. External entities are
subject to the same security concerns as any network operation and
can alter the semantics of an OPDS Catalog Feed Document or OPDS
Catalog Entry Document. The same issues exist for Resources linked
to by elements such as atom:link and atom:content.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="URIs_and_IRIs">
      <h2>URIs and IRIs</h2>
      <p>OPDS Catalog implementations handle URIs and IRIs. See Section 7
of <tt>[RFC3986]</tt> and Section 8 of <tt>[RFC3987]</tt> for
security considerations related to their handling and use.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Code_Injection_and_Cross_Site_Scripting">
      <h2>Code Injection and Cross Site Scripting</h2>
      <p>OPDS Catalogs can contain a broad range of content types
including code that might be executable in some contexts. Malicious
publishers could attempt to attack servers or other clients by
injecting code into OPDS Catalog Feed Documents or OPDS Catalog
Entry Documents or Media Resources.</p>
      <p>Server implementations are strongly encouraged to verify that
external content is safe prior to aggregating, processing, or
publishing it. In the case of HTML, experience indicates that
verification based on a white list of acceptable content is more
effective than a black list of forbidden content.</p>
      <p>Additional information about XHTML and HTML content safety can
be found in Section 8.1 of <tt>[RFC4287]</tt>.</p>

    <h1>The Atom Format Type Parameter</h1>
    <p>The Atom Publishing Protocol <tt>[RFC5023]</tt> defines the Atom
Format Type Parameter.</p>
    <p>Publishers of OPDS Catalogs SHOULD use the "type" parameter to
help clients distinguish between relations to OPDS Catalog Entries

  </div>
  <div id="The_OPDS_Catalog_Profile_Parameter">

This profile parameter provides clients with an advisory hint that
the Resource should be a component of an OPDS Catalog.</p>

# The OPDS Catalog spec extends Atom (RFC4287), and the additions require some

# To simplify OPDS Catalog validation, we do not use Schematron to assert that
# any atom:link with a rel value of ".../acquisition/buy" must be accompanied
# by one or more opds:price elements.
# Instead we rely on Relax NG to describe one of three situations:
# - the rel value is ".../acquisition/buy" and at least one opds:price element
#   is required
# - the rel value is ".../acquisition/borrow" or ".../acquisition/subscribe" or
#   ".../acquisition/sample", in case opds:price elements may be
#   included; or
# - the value of the rel attribute is any other URI or an Atom-defined no-colon
#   name, and no opds:price element is permitted

# Note that this OPDS Catalog schema includes atom.rnc, so that schema must be
# present for validation.
# 
# Note also that atom.rnc defines atomUri as text and not as xsd:anyURI, and so
# wherever the Atom spec requires an IRI, the schema will not check the value
# against any URI pattern or logic. The OPDS Catalog schema overrides atom.rnc
# to provide a relatively accurate test. With the approval of XSD 1.1, the
