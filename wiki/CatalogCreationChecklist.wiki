#summary Guidelines for creating effective Catalogs.

Some items from the specification are optional but strongly recommended. Here's an unordered list of questions to check before releasing a finished Catalog:

  * Are you serving all the Catalog documents using the right Content-Type header?
  * Do you have "start" & "help" links in every feed? 
  * Did you implement search?
  * Are your Publication Collection feeds paginated?
  * Did you provide a "crawlable" feed?
  * Did you validate your Catalogs?
