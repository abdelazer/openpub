== Search ==

  * Cart is unsure why we're using OpenSearch, may be worth investigating options with RSS Cloud and PubSub Hubbub.
  * Steph mentions perhaps this may have to do with maturity/adoption of the standards?
  * Tim: Google's implementation of search protocol uses Open Search.

*Cart will begin a discussion on mailing list on relevance of RssCloud and pubsubhubbub.*

== Acquisition ==
  
  * Roger: Price needs to discussed better, this will be useful everywhere.
  * Cart: was Peter taking care of rental acquisition?
  * Raj: we're still taking care of loaning scenario, using adobe content server, adobe DRM/SDK
  * Cart: RssCloud and pubsubhubbub support this scenario without using adobe.
  * Raj: we don't want to deal with the DRM issue right now, going with the industry standard. Would prefer going with social DRM structure.
  * Roger mentioned XML schema spec, non-normative like use cases and tutorials are placed in separate documents. This might be the approach we want to take. 
  
*Roger to find reference from XML schema, and add this to the spec draft as a reference, as an example appendices. References to how that group handled multiple release of documents - by the end of the week. Already sent to mailing list.*
