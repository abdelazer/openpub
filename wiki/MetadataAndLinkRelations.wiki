#summary List of metadata and link relations in OPDS

Like in AtomPub, an entry in an OPDS feed SHOULD NOT be considered to be a full entry.
Partial entries, MAY have a full entry identified by link@rel="alternate" and the "application/atom+xml;type=entry" mimetype.

= Metadata =

Metadata in OPDS can be:
  * required in the partial entry
  * allowed in the partial entry, and MUST be in the partial entry if they're used
  * strictly allowed in the full entry
If a property is in the partial entry, it MUST be in the full entry too.

== Required in partial entry ==

  * atom:author
  * atom:title
  * atom:summary _(In Atom, you need an atom:content OR an atom:summary. In OPDS we require an atom:summary)_
  * atom:id
  * atom:published _(Corresponds to the publication of the Atom entry, NOT the publication)_
  * dcterms:issued _(Publication date)_

== If present, must be in partial entry ==

  * atom:category _(Should use a scheme and a label)_
  * atom:rights
  * dc:language
  * dc:publisher
  * prism:issue
  * prism:volume

== Full entry ==

All of the elements above and anything else.
Anything in the partial entry MUST be in the full entry too (aside from the link to the full entry).

= Link Relations =

Aside from common link relations (as defined in the [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-link-header-06 Link Header draft] rather than the current [http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml IANA link registry]), several OPDS-specific link relations are created.
