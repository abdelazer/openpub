#summary Informational document about using OPDS for Publications

= Recommended metadata =

Partial Catalog Entries SHOULD include the following metadata elements, if available:

  * dc:extent
  * dc:identifier
  * dc:issued 
  * dc:language
  * dc:publisher

== Relationship Between Atom and Dublin Core Metadata ==

OPDS Catalog providers are encouraged to include metadata from the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Metadata Terms `[DCTERMS]` whenever appropriate. Some of the elements defined in `[DCTERMS]` overlap in meaning with similar elements defined by Atom in `[RFC4287]`. In general, OPDS Catalog Entries prefer the Atom elements over the DCTERMS elements and the following rules should be used by OPDS Catalog providers when choosing elements:

  * OPDS Catalog Entries MUST be identified by an "atom:id". One or more "dc:identifier" elements SHOULD be used to identify the represented Publication, if appropriate metadata is available, and MUST NOT identify the OPDS Catalog Entry.
  * OPDS Catalog Entries MUST include an "atom:updated" element indicating when the OPDS Catalog Entry was last updated. A "dc:issued" element SHOULD be used to indicate the first publication date of the Publication and MUST NOT represent any date related to the OPDS Catalog Entry.
  * OPDS Catalog Entries MUST inlcude an "atom:title" representing the Publication's title and MUST NOT use "dc:title".
  * OPDS Catalog Entries SHOULD use "atom:author" to represent the Publication's creators and SHOULD NOT use "dc:creator".
  * OPDS Catalog Entries SHOULD use "atom:category" to represent the Publication's category, keywords, key phrases, or classification codes and SHOULD NOT use "dc:subject".
  * OPDS Catalog Entries SHOULD use "atom:rights" to represent rights held in and over the Publication and SHOULD NOT use "dc:rights".
  * OPDS Catalog Entries SHOULD use "atom:summary" and/or "atom:content" to describe the Publication SHOULD NOT use "dc:description" or "dc:abstract".
  * OPDS Catalog Entries MAY use "atom:contributor" to represent contributors to the Publication beside its creators.
  * OPDS Catalog Entries MAY use "atom:published" to indicate when the OPDS Catalog Entry was first accessible.


All metadata elements required by Atom are required in OPDS Catalog Entries and Feeds.

Following Atom `[RFC4287]` Section 4.2.6, the content of an "atom:id" identifying an OPDS Catalog Entry MUST NOT change when the OPDS Catalog Entry is "relocated, migrated, syndicated, republished, exported, or imported" and "MUST be created in a way that assures uniqueness."
