#summary A list of standardized search scenarios that OPDS clients should be able to perform for book discovery.

= Search Standardization =

The ability for OPDS clients/readers to be able to search multiple catalogs in a standardized manner is important.

Here are some scenarios involving search that I think we should tackle. Please help in completing and correcting the examples below!

= Simple search =

A client should be able to query a catalog for a for a search term or phrase.

Example: A search for "Mark Twain" will return both books authored by Mark Twain and books about Mark Twain. Books about Mark Twain might include:
  * books with "Mark Twain" in atom:title
  * books with "Mark Twain" atom:category
  * books with "Mark Twain" in the body of the text

Example OpenSearch URL template:
{{{
<Url type="application/atom+xml" template="http://example.com/?q={searchTerms}&amp;pw={startPage?}&amp;format=atom"/>
}}}

= Advanced search =

A client should be able to query a catalog for a for a search term or phrase, and further limit the results by a specific metadata term.

Example: A search for "Missouri" AND author:"Mark Twain" should return books about Missouri written by Mark Twain.

Example OpenSearch URL template: *TODO:* what namespace to we use for author name? Atom or dcterms?
{{{
<Url type="application/atom+xml" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" template="http://example.com/?q={searchTerms}&amp;author={startPage?}&amp;page={atom:author?}&amp;format=atom"/>
}}}
